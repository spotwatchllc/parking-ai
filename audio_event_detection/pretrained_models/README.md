# Overview of audio event detection STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several Tensorflow models for the audio event detection use case pre-trained on custom and public datasets.
Under each model directory, you can find the `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` directory, which contains different audio event detection models trained on various public datasets following the [training section](../src/training/README.md) in STM32 model zoo. 

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/audio_event_detection/).**


You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
