# How to deploy a model on a B-U585I-IOT02A board?

This tutorial explains how to deploy a model from the ST public model zoo directly on your STM32 target board. In this version deployment on the B-U585I-IOT02A and [NAME OF N6 DK] is supported.

For a more detailed tutorial, look at this [tutorial](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main/audio_event_detection/deployment)

## Operation modes:

Depending on what you want to do, you can use the operation modes below:
- Deployment: 
    - To simply deploy a quantized model on the B-U585I-IOT02A board
- chain_qd: 
    - To quantize then deploy the quantized model on the B-U585I-IOT02A board

For any details regarding the parameters of the config file, you can look to the [Deployment documentation](../../../deployment/README.md)


## Deployment yaml configuration example:

Below is an example of configuration file used to deploy a pretrained and quantized yamnet from ST Model Zoo on a B-U585I-IOT02A.
You can find other example of user_config.yaml [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main/audio_event_detection/src/config_file_examples)

The most important parts here are to define:
- The model path of the model to be deployed. This model must be a quantized TFLite or ONNX QDQ model.
- The operation mode to deployment
- The name of the classes
- Copy the preprocessing and feature extraction used during the training of the model (n_fft must be a power of 2)
- Select the example code deployed (sensing_free_rtos or sensing_thread_x)
- Set the target to B-U585I-IOT02A as it is the only one supported
- Select a way (or not) to handle unknown classes (see below)
- Add your local path of STM32CubeIDE

You can look at user_config.yaml examples for any operation mode [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main/audio_event_detection/src/config_file_examples)

## Run the script:

Edit the user_config.yaml then open a terminal (make sure to be in the folder /src). Finally, run the command:

```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py
```
You can also use any .yaml file using command below:
```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path=path_to_the_folder_of_the_yaml --config-name=name_of_your_yaml_file
```

## Important note on "unknown" or "other" classes

A common issue in audio event detection applications is being able to reject samples which do not come from one of the classes the model is trained on. The model zoo provides several baseline options for doing this.
To help solve this issue, there are two option available:
- The first option consists of thresholding the network output probabilities at runtime. This is a na√Øve baseline which does not yield great results, but is a good starting point.
- The second option for OOD detection consists of adding an additional "Other" class to your model at training time, using samples from the dataset which do not belong to any of the classes specified in dataset.class_names.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These two methods are NOT COMPATIBLE, and cannot be used together. You must enable one or the other, or none at all. By default, in the yaml above, only the first option is in use.

You can find all the information needed [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main/audio_event_detection/deployment#3)

## Local deployment:

You can use the [STM32 developer cloud](https://stedgeai-dc.st.com/home) to access the STM32Cube.AI functionalities without installing the software. This requires internet connection and making a free account. Or, alternatively, you can install [STM32Cube.AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) locally. In addition to this you will also need to install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) for building the embedded project.
 
For local installation :
 
- Download and install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
- If opting for using [STM32Cube.AI](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-ai.html) locally, download it then extract both `'.zip'` and `'.pack'` files.
The detailed instructions on installation are available in this [wiki article](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/index.php?title=AI:How_to_install_STM32_model_zoo).

## Application on the board

Once flashed the board can be connected through a serial terminal and the output of the inference can be seen in the serial terminal.
