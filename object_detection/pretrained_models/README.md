# Overview of object detection STM32 model zoo


The STM32 model zoo includes several models for object detection use case pre-trained on custom and public datasets.
Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `Public_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains public object detection models trained on public datasets.
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset` contains different object detection models trained on ST custom datasets using our [training scripts](../src/training). 
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains different object detection models trained on various public datasets following the [training section](../src/training/README.md) in STM32 model zoo.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/object_detection/).**
