# Overview of pose estimation STM32 model zoo


The STM32 model zoo includes several models for object detection use case pre-trained on custom and public datasets.
Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `Public_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset` contains public pose estimation models trained on custom datasets.
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains pose estimation models trained on public datasets.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/pose_estimation/).**
