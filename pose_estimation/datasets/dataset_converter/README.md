# <a xid="">Yolo Darknet Dataset Converter</a>

`converter.py` converts datasets from COCO format to YOLO Darknet format. It currently supports the following formats:
- COCO


## <a>Example</a>

Let's say the the COCO dataset in raw format (with train, val and annotations subfolders) is in PATH_TO_COCO.

To convert this dataset to Yolo Darknet TXT format (the one used in the model zoo) you need to do the following.

For single pose estimation, run the script with the following command:

```
python converter.py --path PATH_TO_COCO --pose single --keypoints 13 --outputdir ./pose_estimation
```

For multiple pose estimation, run the script with the following command:

```
python converter.py --path PATH_TO_COCO --pose multi --keypoints 17 --outputdir ./pose_estimation
```

The converted datasets will be saved in the `./pose_estimation/single/13kpts/train|val` and `./pose_estimation/multi/17kpts/train|val` directories.
