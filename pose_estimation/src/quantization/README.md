# Pose Estimation STM32 Model Quantization

Post-training quantization is a good way to optimize your neural network models before deploying them on a target. This enables the deployment process to be more efficient on your embedded devices by reducing the required memory usage (Flash/RAM) and reducing the inference time, all with little-to-no degradation in model accuracy.

This tutorial shows how to quantize a floating point model with real data.


<details open><summary><a href="#1"><b>1. Configure the YAML file</b></a></summary><a id="1"></a>

All the sections of the YAML file must be set as described in the **[README.md](../README.md)** with the `operation_mode` set to quantization. Alternatively, you can specify the `operation_mode` later when running the experiment by using `python stm32ai_main.py operation_mode=quantization`.

<ul><details open><summary><a href="#1-1">1.1 Prepare the dataset</a></summary><a id="1-1"></a>

Information about the dataset you want to use for activations calibration is provided in the `dataset` section of the configuration file, as shown in the YAML code below.

```yaml
dataset:
  name: COCO_2017_pose
  test_path:
  quantization_path: ../datasets/COCO_2017_person
  quantization_split: 0.4
  seed: 0
```

In this example, the only provided path is the `quantization_path`. It could be the full training set or a specific set dedicated to activations calibration. The state machine below describes the rules to follow when handling dataset paths for quantization.

</div>

If you only want to quantize the model on a random part of your quantization set, simply set the percentage value in the `quantization_split` parameter.

<ul><details open><summary><a href="#1-2">1.2 Apply preprocessing</a></summary><a id="1-2"></a>

The images from the dataset need to be preprocessed before they are presented to the network for quantization. This includes rescaling and resizing. In particular, they need to be rescaled exactly as they were during the training step. This is illustrated in the YAML code below:

```yaml
preprocessing:
  rescaling: { scale: 1/127.5, offset: -1 }
  resizing:
    aspect_ratio: "fit"
    interpolation: nearest
  color_mode: rgb
```

In this example, the pixels of the input images read from the dataset are in the interval [0, 255], which is UINT8. If you set `scale` to 1./255 and `offset` to 0, they will be rescaled to the interval [0.0, 1.0]. If you set `scale` to 1/127.5 and `offset` to -1, they will be rescaled to the interval [-1.0, 1.0].

The `resizing` attribute specifies the image resizing methods you want to use:

- The value of `interpolation` must be one of *{"bilinear", "nearest", "bicubic", "area", "lanczos3", "lanczos5", "gaussian", "mitchellcubic"}*.
- The value of `aspect_ratio` must be *"fit"* as we do not support other values such as *"crop"*. If you set it to *"fit"*, the resized images will be distorted if their original aspect ratio is not the same as the resizing size.

The `color_mode` attribute must be one of "*grayscale*", "*rgb*" or "*rgba*".

</details></ul>
<ul><details open><summary><a href="#1-3">1.3 Set the model and quantization parameters</a></summary><a id="1-3"></a>

As mentioned previously, all the sections of the YAML file must be set in accordance with this **[README.md](../README.md)**. In particular, `operation_mode` should be set to quantization and the `quantization` section should be filled as in the following example:

```yaml
general:
  model_path: ../../../model_zoo/pose_estimation/movenet/Public_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset/custom_dataset_person_17kpts/movenet_lightning_heatmaps_192/movenet_lightning_heatmaps_192.h5
  model_type: heatmaps_spe
quantization:
  quantizer: TFlite_converter
  quantization_type: PTQ
  quantization_input_type: uint8
  quantization_output_type: float
  granularity: per_channel  # Optional, defaults to "per_channel".
  optimize: False           # Optional, defaults to False.
  export_dir: quantized_models
```

**where**:

- `model_path` - *String*, specifies the path of the model to be quantized.
- `quantizer` - *String*, "TFlite_converter" or "onnx_quantizer" which will convert model trained weights from float to integer values. The quantized model will be saved in ONNX or TensorFlow Lite format.
- `quantization_type` - *String*, only option is "PTQ", i.e. "Post-Training Quantization".
- `quantization_input_type` - *String*, can be "int8", "uint8" or "float", represents the quantization type for the model input.
- `quantization_output_type` - *String*, can be "int8", "uint8" or "float", represents the quantization type for the model output.
- `granularity` - *String*, can be "per_tensor" or "per_channel", defines the quantization granularity.
- `optimize` - *Boolean*, can be either True or False, controls whether the user wants to optimize the model before attempting to quantize it.
- `export_dir` - *String*, refers to the directory name to save the quantized model.

</details></ul>
<ul><details open><summary><a href="#1-4">1.4 Random quantization</a></summary><a id="1-4"></a>

When no path is specified in either `quantization_path` or `training_path`, the model is quantized after calibration on random data. There is no interest in evaluating the accuracy in this case. However, this random quantization can be useful to quickly estimate the model footprints on a target after quantization. We will see how to proceed in the next section.

</details></ul>
<ul><details open><summary><a href="#1-5">1.5 Hydra and MLflow settings</a></summary><a id="1-5"></a>

The `mlflow` and `hydra` sections must always be present in the YAML configuration file. The `hydra` section can be used to specify the name of the directory where experiment directories are saved and/or the pattern used to name experiment directories. With the YAML code below, every time you run the Model Zoo, an experiment directory is created that contains all the directories and files created during the run. The names of experiment directories are all unique as they are based on the date and time of the run.

```yaml
hydra:
  run:
    dir: ./experiments_outputs/${now:%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S}
```

The `mlflow` section is used to specify the location and name of the directory where MLflow files are saved, as shown
below:

```yaml
mlflow:
  uri: ./experiments_outputs/mlruns
```

<details open><summary><a href="#2"><b>2. Quantize your model</b></a></summary><a id="2"></a>

To launch your model quantization using a real dataset, run the following command from the **src/** folder:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name quantization_config.yaml
```

The quantized TFLite model can be found in the corresponding **experiments_outputs/** folder.

In case you want to evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model, you can either launch the evaluation operation mode on the generated quantized model (please refer to the evaluation **[README.md](../evaluation/README.md)** that describes in detail how to proceed) or you can use chained services like launching [chain_eqe](../config_file_examples/chain_eqe_config.yaml) example with the command below:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name chain_eqe_config.yaml
```

In case you want to evaluate your quantized model footprints, you can either launch the benchmark operation mode on the generated quantized model (please refer to the benchmarking **[README.md](../benchmarking/README.md)** that describes in detail how to proceed) or you can use chained services like launching [chain_qb](../config_file_examples/chain_qb_config.yaml) example with the command below:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name chain_qb_config.yaml
```

Chained services work whether you specify a quantization dataset or not (random quantization).
