# Overview of Instance Segmentation STM32 Model Zoo

The STM32 model zoo provides guidance on using instance segmentation models. While we do not include any models directly in this repository, we propose using models available in a fork of the Ultralytics repository.

You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
