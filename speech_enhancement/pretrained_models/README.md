# Overview of Speech Enhancement STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes pretrained speech enhancement models, ready for deployment on STM32N6 hardware.

You will find the following directory : 

- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains different speech enhancement models trained on public datasets following the [training section](../src/trainers/README.md) in STM32 model zoo. Currently, only models trained on the [ CSTR VCTK + DEMAND, a.k.a. Valentini](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791) dataset are available.


You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
