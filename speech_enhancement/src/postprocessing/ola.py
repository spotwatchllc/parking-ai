def overlap_add(frames, hop_length, window=None, output_length=None):
    """
    Overlap-add in the time domain.
    Accepts windowed signals. Functions as an inverse to librosa.utils.frames
	NOTE : The reconstructed signal will likely not be the same length
	as the input signal to librosa.util.frame, because some samples at the 
	end of the signal are discarded during the framing operation.
	The exact number of samples discarded is (signal_length - frame_length) % hop_length.
	To avoid this you can clip the input to librosa.util.frame so that 
	(signal_length - frame_length) % hop_length = 0

	Inputs
	------
	frames : np.ndarray of shape (..., n_frames, frame_length)
		Input signal frames. Frames are assumed to be the same length.
	hop_length : hop length between frames
    window : string, tuple, number, callable, or list-like
        - If string, it's the name of the window function (e.g., `'hann'`)
        - If tuple, it's the name of the window function and any parameters
          (e.g., `('kaiser', 4.0)`)
        - If numeric, it is treated as the beta parameter of the `'kaiser'`
          window, as in `scipy.signal.get_window`.
        - If callable, it's a function that accepts one integer argument
          (the window length, here frame_length)
        - If list-like, it's a pre-computed window of the correct length `frame_length`
        NOTE : This is passed to librosa.filter.get_window, so anything you'd use in a "window" arg
        in librosa works here.
    output_length : Desired signal length of reconstructed output. 
		If specified, the reconstructed output will be clipped or zero-padded
        to the right to fit output_length.
        If None, the reconstructed output will be of 
        shape (..., n_samples) where n_samples = frame_length + (hop_length - 1) * n_frames
	Outputs
	-------
