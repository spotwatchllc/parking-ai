# Overview of ST multi-zone Time-of-Flight sensors hand posture recognition STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several models for hand posture recognition use cases pre-trained on custom datasets. Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `ST_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset` contains different hand posture models trained on ST custom datasets using our [training scripts](../src/config_file_examples/training_config.yaml). 

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/hand_posture/).**


You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
