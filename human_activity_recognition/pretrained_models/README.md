# Overview of human activity recognition STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several models for the human activity recognition (HAR) use case pre-trained on custom and public datasets. Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `ST_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset` directory contains different human activity recognition models trained on ST custom datasets. 
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` directory contains different human activity recognition models trained on public datasets.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/human_activity_recognition/).**


You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
