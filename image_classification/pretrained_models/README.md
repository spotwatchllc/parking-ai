# Overview of image classification STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several models for image classification use cases pre-trained on custom and public datasets. Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `Public_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains public image classification models trained on public datasets.
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_custom_dataset` contains different image classification models trained on ST custom datasets using our [training scripts](../src/training/README.md). 
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains different image classification models trained on various public datasets following the [training section](../src/training/README.md) in STM32 model zoo.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/image_classification/).**
