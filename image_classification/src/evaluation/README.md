# Evaluation of Image Classification model

Our evaluation service is a comprehensive tool that enables users to assess the accuracy of their ONNX (float or QDQ), TensorFlow Lite (.tflite), or Keras (.h5) image classification models. By uploading their model and a validation set, users can quickly and easily evaluate the performance of their model and generate various metrics, such as accuracy.

The evaluation service is designed to be fast, efficient, and accurate, making it an essential tool for anyone looking to evaluate the performance of their image classification model.

To use this service and achieve your goals, you can use the [user_config.yaml](../user_config.yaml) or directly update the [evaluation_config.yaml](../config_file_examples/evaluation_config.yaml) file and use it. This file provides an example of how to configure the evaluation service to meet your specific needs.

Alternatively, you can follow the tutorial below, which shows how to evaluate your pre-trained image classification model using our evaluation service.

<details open><summary><a href="#1-1">1.1 Set the model and the operation mode</a></summary><a id="1-1"></a>

As mentioned previously, all the sections of the YAML file must be set in accordance with this **[evaluation_config.yaml](../config_file_examples/evaluation_config.yaml)**.
In particular, `operation_mode` should be set to evaluation and the `evaluation` section should be filled as in the following example: 

```yaml
general:
   model_path: ../../../model_zoo/image_classification/mobilenetv2/ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset/flowers/mobilenet_v2_0.35_128_fft/mobilenet_v2_0.35_128_fft.h5

operation_mode: evaluation
```
In this example, the path to the MobileNet V2 model is provided in the `model_path` parameter.

```yaml
evaluation:
   target: host # host, stedgeai_host, stedgeai_n6
```
In the 'evaluation' section, if users are using a quantized TFLITE or ONNX model, they can decide to do the inferences with the classic python interpreters (host -> by default), with the C code generated by stedgeai on the PC (stedgeai_host), or with the C code generated by stedgeai on the N6 board directly (stedgeai_n6) using the `target` attribute.

<details open><summary><a href="#1-2">1.2 Prepare the dataset</a></summary><a id="1-2"></a>

Information about the dataset you want to use for evaluation is provided in the `dataset` section of the configuration file, as shown in the YAML code below.

```yaml
dataset:
   dataset_name: flowers                                      # Dataset name. Optional, defaults to "<unnamed>".
   test_path: <test-set-root-directory>                       # Path to the root directory of the test set.
   check_image_files: False                                   # Enable/disable image file checking.
```
In this example, the path to the validation set is provided in the `test_path` parameter.

State machine below describes the rules to follow when handling dataset path for the evaluation.

</div>

When working with a dataset for the first time, we suggest setting the `check_image_files` attribute to True. This will enable the system to load each image file and identify any corrupt, unsupported, or non-image files. The path to any problematic files will be reported.

In cases where there is no validation set path or test set provided to evaluate the model trained using the training service, the available data under the `training_path` directory is split into two to create a training set and a validation set. By default, 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% is used for the validation set in the evaluation service.

If you want to use a different split ratio, you need to specify the percentage to be used for the validation set in the `validation_split` parameter (to ensure consistency in the [training](../training/README.md) and evaluation process, you must specify the same validation_split parameter value in both the training and evaluation services), as shown in the YAML example below:

```yaml
dataset:
   name: flowers
   class_names: [daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips]
   training_path: ../datasets/flower_photos
   validation_path:
   validation_split: 0.20
   test_path:
```

<details open><summary><a href="#1-3">1.3 Apply preprocessing</a></summary><a id="1-3"></a>

The images from the dataset need to be preprocessed before they are presented to the network for evaluation.
This includes rescaling and resizing. In particular, they need to be rescaled exactly as they were at the training step.
This is illustrated in the YAML code below:

```yaml
preprocessing:
   rescaling: { scale: 1/127.5, offset: -1 }
   resizing: 
     aspect_ratio: "fit"
     interpolation: nearest
  color_mode: rgb
```

In this example, the pixels of the input images read in the dataset are in the interval [0, 255], that is UINT8. If you set `scale` to 1./255 and `offset` to 0, they will be rescaled to the interval [0.0, 1.0]. 
If you set `scale` to 1/127.5 and `offset` to -1, they will be rescaled to the interval [-1.0, 1.0].

The `resizing` attribute specifies the image resizing methods you want to use:
- The value of `interpolation` must be one of *{"bilinear", "nearest", "bicubic", "area", "lanczos3", "lanczos5", "gaussian", "mitchellcubic"}*.
- The value of `aspect_ratio` must be either *"fit"* or *"crop"*. If you set it to *"fit"*, the resized images will be distorted if their original aspect ratio is not the same as in the resizing size. 
If you set it to *"crop"*, images will be cropped as necessary to preserve the aspect ratio.

The `color_mode` attribute must be one of "*grayscale*", "*rgb*" or "*rgba*".

<details open><summary><a href="#1-4">1.4 Hydra and MLflow settings</a></summary><a id="1-4"></a>

The `mlflow` and `hydra` sections must always be present in the YAML configuration file. The `hydra` section can be used to specify the name of the directory where experiment directories are saved and/or the pattern used to name experiment directories. With the YAML code below, every time you run the Model Zoo, an experiment directory is created that contains all the directories and files created during the run. The names of experiment directories are all unique as they are based on the date and time of the run.

```yaml
hydra:
   run:
      dir: ./experiments_outputs/${now:%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S}
```

The `mlflow` section is used to specify the location and name of the directory where MLflow files are saved, as shown below:

```yaml
mlflow:
   uri: ./experiments_outputs/mlruns
```

<summary><a href="#2"><b>2. Evaluate your model</b></a></summary><a id="2"></a>

If you chose to modify the [user_config.yaml](../user_config.yaml), you can evaluate the model by running the following command from the **src/** folder:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py 
```
If you chose to update the [evaluation_config.yaml](../config_file_examples/evaluation_config.yaml) and use it, then run the following command from the **src/** folder:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name evaluation_config.yaml
```
In case you want to evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model then benchmark it, you can either launch the evaluation operation mode followed by the [benchmark service](../benchmarking/README.md) that describes in detail how to proceed or you can use chained services like launching **[chain_eqeb](../config_file_examples/chain_eqeb_config.yaml)** example with the command below:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name chain_eqeb_config.yaml
```
